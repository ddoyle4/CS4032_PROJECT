    -- code, making it far easier to maintain. Also, in cases where the input can be more complex than just a Maybe
    -- type, it allows you as a programming style to separate out the complexity of working out what you have been
    -- given. In the Socket progrmming, if you adopted a decent style, you probably spent quite a lot of time writing
    -- handler functions that did exactly this kind of plumbing. No need in Haskell - you get it for free, and entirely
    -- type checked. This is a big win in practice.
